  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
      Hi, My name is Henry darling. I am 23 years old. I was born on Spetember 20<sup>th</sup> I am currently enrolled in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. Right now the course is entirely online. I am enjoying the online
      classes because it means i do not have to take a bus for 2 hours per day. 
  </p>
  <p>
      When I am not in class I enjoy a couple of hobbies: 
      <ul>
          <li><abbr title="Type of Rock Climbing">Bouldering</abbr></li> 
          <li>Video Games</li>
          <li>Photography</li> 
      </ul>
      Right now I really enjoy bouldering. Bouldering is a type of rock climbing that focuses more on shear strength
      and technique but does not use ropes. Normally people do not go as high bouldering because of the saftey concerns.  <a href="/notes.html">Click Here</a> for a list of some of my favourite html tags!
