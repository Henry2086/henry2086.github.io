            <h3>My Favourite Quote</h2>
            <p>
            <blockquote>1... 2... 3... GO - <cite>Steve-O</cite></blockquote>
            This quote is from the actor Steve-O, it is about his mentality when approacing <em>daunting</em> or <em>challenging tasks</em>. Once you say go you do it, you dont let yourself think beyond the go and just do the task ahead of you.
